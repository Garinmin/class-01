# Introduction to React and Components

## What Is React?

React is a declarative, efficient, and flexible JavaScript library for building user interfaces. It lets you compose complex UIs from small and isolated pieces of code called “components”.
The smallest React example looks like this:
```
   ReactDOM.render(
      <h1>Hello, world!</h1>,
      document.getElementById('root')
   );
```

## JSX

JSX - is a syntax extension to JavaScript.
You can use variable inside JSX by wrapping it in curly braces:
```
const name = 'Josh Perez';
const element = <h1>Hello, {name}</h1>;
```

 Also, you can use JSX inside of if statements and for loops, assign it to variables, accept it as arguments, and return it from functions:
 ```
 function getGreeting(user) {
   if (user) {
     return <h1>Hello, {formatName(user)}!</h1>;
   }
   return <h1>Hello, Stranger.</h1>;
 }
```
If a tag is empty, you may close it immediately with />:
```
const element = <img src={user.avatarUrl} />;
```

## Rendering Elements

Elements are the smallest building blocks of React apps.
An element describes what you want to see on the screen:
```
const element = <h1>Hello, world</h1>;
```
To render a React element into a root DOM node:
```
<div id="root"></div>                                         HTML

const element = <h1>Hello, world</h1>;                        JS
ReactDOM.render(element, document.getElementById('root'));
```
!!! React elements are immutable.
    The only way to update the UI is to create a new element.
    
## Components and Props

Components let you split the UI into independent, reusable pieces, and think about each piece in isolation.
```
function Welcome(props) {
  return <h1>Hello, {props.name}</h1>;
}
```
This function is a valid React component because it accepts a single “props” object argument with data and returns a React element.
All React components must act like pure functions with respect to their props.
