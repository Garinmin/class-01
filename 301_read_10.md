# In memory storage

### What is a call stack?

A call stack is a data structure that uses the Last In, First Out (LIFO) principle to temporarily store and manage function invocation (call).
**Manage function invocation (call):** The call stack maintains a record of the position of each stack frame. It knows the next function to be executed (and will remove it after execution). This is what makes code execution in JavaScript synchronous.

### What causes a stack overflow?

A stack overflow occurs when there is a recursive function (a function that calls itself) without an exit point. The browser (hosting environment) has a maximum stack call that it can accomodate before throwing a stack error.
```
    function callMyself(){
      callMyself();
    }

    callMyself();
```
### In summary

The key takeaways from the call stack are:

1. It is single-threaded. Meaning it can only do one thing at a time.
2. Code execution is synchronous.
3. A function invocation creates a stack frame that occupies a temporary memory.
4. It works as a LIFO â€” Last In, First Out data structure.

### Types of error messages

#### 1. Reference errors

Example: when you try to use a variable that is not yet declared you get this type os errors.
```
    console.log(foo) // Uncaught ReferenceError: foo is not defined
```
#### 2. Syntax errors

```
JSON.parse( {'foo': 'bar'} ) // Uncaught SyntaxError: Unexpected token o in JSON at position 1
```
Should be:
```
JSON.parse('{"foo":"bar"}')
```
#### 3. Range errors

Example: An array for instance cannot have a negative length
```
    var foo= []
    foo.length = foo.length -1 // Uncaught RangeError: Invalid array length
```
#### 4. Type errors

like accessing a property in an undefined type of variable.
```
var foo = {}
foo.bar // undefined
foo.bar.baz // Uncaught TypeError: Cannot read property 'baz' of undefined
```
### Tools to avoid runtime errors

JS is not a compiled language like Java so your errors will happen at runtime.

Thankfully, to save us quite some time you can use tools like:

- ```quokka``` to evaluate your code as you type
- ```eslint``` to make sure your style guide is consistency and it will grab you an error or two along the way and
