# Authentication

## What is OAuth?

**OAuth** is an open-standard authorization protocol or framework that describes how unrelated servers and services can safely allow authenticated access to their assets without actually sharing the initial, related, single logon credential.
OAuth allows websites and services to share assets among users.
The simplest example of OAuth is when you go to log onto a website and it offers one or more opportunities to log on using another website’s/service’s logon. You then click on the button linked to the other website, the other website authenticates you, and the website you were originally connecting to logs you on itself afterward using permission gained from the second website.
Another common example OAuth scenario could be a user sending cloud-stored files to another user via email.
```Authentication``` - is the process of a user/subject proving its ownership of a presented identity, by providing a password or some other uniquely owned or presented factor.
```Authorization``` - is the process of letting a subject access resources after a successful authentication, oftentimes somewhere else.
In simple terms, authentication is the process of verifying who a user is, while authorization is the process of verifying what they have access to.

## How OAuth works

Let’s assume a user has already signed into one website or service.
1. The first website connects to the second website on behalf of the user, using OAuth.
2. The second site generates a one-time token and a one-time secret.
3. The first site gives this token and secret to the initiating user’s client software.
4. The client’s software presents the request token and secret to their authorization provider.
5. The user approves a particular transaction type at the first website.
6. The user is given an approved access token.
7. The user gives the approved access token to the first website.
8. The first website gives the access token to the second website.
9. The second website lets the first website access their site on behalf of the user.

## Auth0 React SDK for Single Page Apps

The ```Auth0 React SDK (auth0-react.js)``` is a JavaScript library for implementing authentication and authorization in React apps with Auth0.
You have a few options for using auth0-react.js in your project.

From the CDN: ```<script src="https://cdn.auth0.com/js/auth0-react/1.2.0/auth0-react.min.js"></script>```

From npm: ```npm install @auth0/auth0-react```

From yarn: ```yarn add @auth0/auth0-react```

First, you'll need to wrap your application in a single Auth0Provider component. This will provide the React Context to components that are placed inside your application.

```import React from 'react';
    import ReactDOM from 'react-dom';
    import { Auth0Provider } from '@auth0/auth0-react';
    import App from './App';
    ReactDOM.render(
      <Auth0Provider
        domain="YOUR_DOMAIN"
        clientId="YOUR_CLIENT_ID"
        redirectUri={window.location.origin}
      >
        <App />
      </Auth0Provider>,
      document.getElementById('app')
    );
 ```
