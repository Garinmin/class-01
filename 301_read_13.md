# CRUD

```CRUD``` (Create, Read, Update, Delete) When we are building APIs, we want our models to provide four basic types of functionality. The model must be able to Create, Read, Update, and Delete resources.

In your own words, describe what each group of status code represents:

100’s = the header part of the request has been received and the server will try to comply with a transmission demand of the client.

200’s = the request has succeeded.

300’s = the resource they are requesting isn’t available at the expected location anymore.

400’s = invalid requests a client sent to a server (timeouts, wrong URI, missing authentication). 

500’s = the problem with server.

What is a status code 202? This code tells the client that the request was valid, but its processing will finish sometime in the future (when asynchronous processing).

What is a status code 308? This is the right code if the resource will now be available at a new URL and the client should directly access it via the new URL in the future.

What code would you use if an update didn’t return data to a client? 400–499 (I think 406).

What code would you use if a resource used to exist but no longer does? 300–399

What is the ‘Forbidden’ status code? 401,403 inciorrect authorization.

What is middleware? It is software that provides common services and capabilities to applications outside of what's offered by the operating system. Data management, application services, messaging, authentication, and API management are all commonly handled by middleware.

What does app.use(express.json()) do? The app use express.json middleware that convert request body to JSON.

What is the difference beween PUT and PATCH? 
The PUT method uses the request URI to supply a modified version of the requested resource which replaces the original version of the resource. 
Thehe PATCH method supplies a set of instructions to modify the resource.

How do you make a defalut value in a schema? 
Use the ```setDefaultsOnInsert``` option.

What does a 500 error status code mean? 
It means Internal Server Error, which can be anything from a missing header field the backend accessed without checking its existence to an unreachable third party service the backend wanted to call.

What is the difference between a status 200 and a status 201? 
The 200 means that the request was received and understood and is being processed. 
The 201 status code indicates that a request was successful and as a result, a resource has been created (for example a new page).
