# Diversity & Inclusion in the Tech Industry

## When are diversity efforts most successful?

Diversity efforts are most successful when they’re driven by a commitment from company leaders. 
And meaningful commitment requires leaders to understand why diversity matters.

## Why do diverse companies perform better?

1. Diverse teams are smarter and more creative than homogeneous ones.
2. Failing to attract and hire employees from underrepresented backgrounds leads companies to miss out on incredible talent.
3. Diverse companies can better serve a diverse user base.
4. Diverse groups of people bring to organizations more and different ways of seeing a problem and, thus, faster/better ways of solving it.

## Give an example of how a diverse company can serve a diverse user base or vise-versa.

And in a 2003 study looking at 177 banks across the U.S., researchers found that for banks focused on innovation, racial diversity was clearly tied to better financial performance.
When YouTube’s almost entirely right-handed developer team built the iOS app without considering how left-handed people would use it, for example, 5% to 10% of videos were uploaded upside down as a result.
