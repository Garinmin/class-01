# State and Props

## Handling Events

Handling events with React elements is very similar to handling events on DOM elements. There are some syntax differences:

- React events are named using camelCase, rather than lowercase.
- With JSX you pass a function as the event handler, rather than a string.
```
      <button onclick="activateLasers()">
      Activate Lasers                            HTML
      </button>
      
      <button onClick={activateLasers}>
      Activate Lasers                            React
      </button>
```

When using React, you donâ€™t need to call addEventListener to add listeners to a DOM element after it is created. Instead, just provide a listener when the element is initially rendered.

## Conditional Rendering

In React, you can create distinct components that encapsulate behavior you need.
You may embed expressions in JSX by wrapping them in curly braces. 
```
    function Mailbox(props) {
      const unreadMessages = props.unreadMessages;
      return (
        <div>
          <h1>Hello!</h1>
          {unreadMessages.length > 0 &&
            <h2>
              You have {unreadMessages.length} unread messages.
            </h2>
          }
        </div>
      );
    }
```
Another method for conditionally rendering elements inline is to use the JavaScript conditional operator condition ? true : false:
```
      render() {
        const isLoggedIn = this.state.isLoggedIn;
        return (
          <div>
            The user is <b>{isLoggedIn ? 'currently' : 'not'}</b> logged in.
          </div>
        );
      }
```
