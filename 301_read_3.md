# Passing Functions as Props

## Lifting State Up

Often, several components need to reflect the same changing data.
In React, sharing state is accomplished by moving it up to the closest common ancestor of the components that need it.

## Lists and Keys

We use the map() function to take an array of numbers and double their values:
```
    const numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
    const doubled = numbers.map((number) => number * 2);
    console.log(doubled);
```

## Keys

Keys help React identify which items have changed, are added, or are removed. 
Keys should be given to the elements inside the array to give the elements a stable identity:
```
    const numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
    const listItems = numbers.map((number) =>
      <li key={number.toString()}>
        {number}
      </li>
    );
```
Most often you would use IDs from your data as keys:
```
    const todoItems = todos.map((todo) =>
      <li key={todo.id}>
        {todo.text}
      </li>
    );
```
JSX allows embedding any expression in curly braces so we could inline the map() result:
```
    function NumberList(props) {
      const numbers = props.numbers;
      return (
        <ul>
          {numbers.map((number) =>
            <ListItem key={number.toString()}
                      value={number} />
          )}
        </ul>
      );
    }
```
