# React and Forms

## Forms

In HTML there are of browsing to a new page when the user submits the form. 
React handles the submission of the form and has access to the data that the user entered into the form. 
The standard way to achieve this is with a technique called “controlled components”.
With a controlled component, the input’s value is always driven by the React state.
When you need to handle multiple controlled ```input``` elements, you can add a ```name``` attribute to each element 
and let the handler function choose what to do based on the value of ```event.target.name```.

### Form controls

For textual form controls—like ```inputs```, ```selects```, and ```textareas```—use the ```FormControl``` component. 
FormControl adds some additional styles for general appearance, focus state, sizing, and more.
```
    <Form>
      <Form.Group>
        <Form.File id="exampleFormControlFile1" label="Example file input" />
      </Form.Group>
    </Form>
```
You can use ```size``` on ```<FormControl>``` and ```<FormLabel>``` to change the size of inputs and labels respectively:
```
<Form.Group>
      <Form.Control size="lg" type="text" placeholder="Large text" />
      <br />
      <Form.Control type="text" placeholder="Normal text" />
      <br />
      <Form.Control size="sm" type="text" placeholder="Small text" />
      </Form.Group>
```
FormControl and FormCheck both apply ```display: block``` with ```width: 100%``` to controls, which means they stack vertically by default. 
Additional components and props can be used to vary this layout on a per-form basis.
