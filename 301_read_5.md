# Thinking in React

React is the premier way to build big, fast Web apps with JavaScript.
One of the many great parts of React is how it makes us think about apps as you build them.
Basic steps when creating a React project:

### 1. Break The UI Into A Component Hierarchy
```
   - FilterableProductTable
      - SearchBar
      - ProductTable
         - ProductCategoryRow
         - ProductRow
```
### 2. Build A Static Version in React

The easiest way is to build a version that takes your data model and renders the UI but has no interactivity.

```
class ProductCategoryRow extends React.Component {
  render() {
    const category = this.props.category;
    return (
      <tr>
        <th colSpan="2">
          {category}
        </th>
      </tr>
    );
  }
}

class ProductRow extends React.Component {
  render() {
    const product = this.props.product;
    const name = product.stocked ?
      product.name :
      <span style={{color: 'red'}}>
        {product.name}
      </span>;

    return (
      <tr>
        <td>{name}</td>
        <td>{product.price}</td>
      </tr>
    );
  }
}
...
```

### 3. Identify The Minimal Representation Of UI State

To make UI interactive, you need to be able to trigger changes to your underlying data model. React achieves this with state.

### 4. Identify Where Your State Should Live

Now we need to identify which component mutates, or owns, this state.
React is all about one-way data flow down the component hierarchy.
For each piece of state in your application:
- Identify every component that renders something based on that state.
- Find a common owner component.
- Either the common owner or another component higher up in the hierarchy should own the state.
- If you can’t find a component where it makes sense to own the state, create a new component.

### 5. Add Inverse Data Flow

Now it’s time to support data flowing the other way.
Whenever the user changes the form, we update the state to reflect the user input.
