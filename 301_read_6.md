# NODE.JS

Node.js® is a JavaScript runtime built on Chrome’s V8 JavaScript engine.

### How Do I Install Node.js?

You can install from [the official Node download page](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) or [Install Multiple Versions of Node.js using nvm](Install Multiple Versions of Node.js using nvm)
You can check that Node is installed on your system by opening a terminal and typing ```node -v```. If all has gone well, you should see something like ```v12.14.1``` displayed.
Next, create a new file hello.js and copy in the following code:
```
console.log("Hello, World!");
```
To run the example, enter the following command:
```
node hello.js
```

### What Are the Advantages of Node.js?

- You can do everything in the same language, which, as a developer, makes you more productive (and hopefully, happier). For example, you can easily share code between the server and the client.
- Node.js speaks JSON.
- Most of us are familiar with JavaScript, or have used it at some point.

## The basics of async/await

### The async keyword

First of all we have the ```async``` keyword, which you put in front of a function declaration to turn it into an async function. 
An async function is a function that knows how to expect the possibility of the await keyword being used to invoke asynchronous code.
This is one of the traits of async functions — their return values are guaranteed to be converted to promises.
So the async keyword is added to functions to tell them to return a promise rather than directly returning the value.
```
    async function hello() { return "Hello" };
    hello();
```

### The await keyword

The advantage of an async function only becomes apparent when you combine it with the ```await``` keyword.
```await``` can be put in front of any async promise-based function to pause your code on that line until the promise fulfills, then return the resulting value.
```
    async function hello() {
      return greeting = await Promise.resolve("Hello");
    };
    hello().then(alert);
```
