# REST

The whole world wide web is built on an architectural style called “REST”. REST provides a definition of a “resource”, which is what those things point to.
A web page is a “representation” of a resource. Resources are just concepts. URLs--those things that you type into the browser.
there's this concept that people are calling “Web Services” or "APIs". Machines could use the web just like people do.
HTTP is all about applying verbs to nouns. When you go to a web page, the browser does an HTTP GET on the URL you type in and back comes a web page.

# What Google Learned About Teams

Today’s most valuable firms have come to realize that analyzing and improving individual workers ­— a practice known as ‘‘employee performance optimization’’ — isn’t enough.
Studies show that people working in teams tend to achieve better results and report higher job satisfaction.
In 2012, the Google company embarked on an initiative — code-named Project Aristotle — to study hundreds of teams and figure out why some stumbled while others soared. 
After looking at over a hundred groups for more than a year, Project Aristotle researchers concluded that understanding and influencing group norms were the keys to improving Google’s teams. 
As the researchers studied the groups, however, they noticed two behaviors that all the good teams generally shared. First, on the good teams, members spoke in roughly the same proportion, a phenomenon the researchers referred to as ‘‘equality in distribution of conversational turn-taking.’’ Second, the good teams all had high ‘‘average social sensitivity’’ — a fancy way of saying they were skilled at intuiting how others felt based on their tone of voice, their expressions and other nonverbal cues. 
Google’s data indicated that psychological safety, more than anything else, was critical to making a team work.
In the best teams, members listen to one another and show sensitivity to feelings and needs.
Project Aristotle is a reminder that when companies try to optimize everything, it’s sometimes easy to forget that success is often built on experiences — like emotional interactions and complicated conversations and discussions.
