# APIs

Most modern web applications expose APIs that clients can use to interact with the application. A well-designed web API should aim to support:

- Platform independence.
- Service evolution.

Focus on the business entities that the web API exposes. 
Resource URIs should be based on nouns (the resource) and not verbs (the operations on the resource).

```

## API-methods

### GET methods

A successful GET method typically returns HTTP status code 200 (OK). If the resource cannot be found, the method should return 404 (Not Found).

### POST methods

If a POST method creates a new resource, it returns HTTP status code 201 (Created). The URI of the new resource is included in the Location header of the response.
If the client puts invalid data into the request, the server should return HTTP status code 400 (Bad Request).

### PUT methods

If a PUT method creates a new resource, it returns HTTP status code 201 (Created), as with a POST method. If the method updates an existing resource, it returns either 200 (OK) or 204 (No Content). In that case, consider returning HTTP status code 409 (Conflict).

### PATCH methods

With a PATCH request, the client sends a set of updates to an existing resource, in the form of a patch document. 

### DELETE methods

If the delete operation is successful, the web server should respond with HTTP status code 204.

## SuperAgent

SuperAgent is light-weight progressive ajax API crafted for flexibility, readability, and a low learning curve after being frustrated with many of the existing request APIs. It also works with Node.js!
```
    request
       .get('/search')
       .then(res => {
          // res.body, res.headers, res.status
       })
       .catch(err => {
          // err.message, err.response
       });
```
For set header fields is simple, invoke .set() with a field name and value:
```
     request
       .get('/search')
       .set('API-Key', 'foobar')
       .set('Accept', 'application/json')
       .then(callback);
```
