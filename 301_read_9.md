# FUNCTIONAL PROGRAMMING

### What is functional programming?

Functional programming is a programming paradigm that treats computation as the evaluation of mathematical functions and avoids changing-state and mutable data.

### Pure functions

- It returns the same result if given the same arguments.

1. The function is an impure if uses a global object that was not passed as a parameter to the function.
2. If our function reads external files, it’s not a pure function — the file’s contents can change.
3. Any function that relies on a random number generator cannot be pure.

- It does not cause any observable side effects.

Examples of observable side effects include modifying a global object or a parameter passed by reference.
```
    let counter = 1;

    function increaseCounter(value) {               Impure function
      counter = value + 1;
    }                                          
    increaseCounter(counter);
    console.log(counter); // 2


    let counter = 1;

    const increaseCounter = (value) => value + 1;     Pure function
    increaseCounter(counter); // 2
    console.log(counter); // 1
```
Pure functions are stable, consistent, and predictable. Given the same parameters, pure functions will always return the same result.

### Referential transparency

If a function consistently yields the same result for the same input, it is referentially transparent.

```pure functions + immutable data = referential transparency```

### Functions as first-class entities

The idea is to treat functions as values and pass functions like data.

### Higher-order functions

When we talk about higher-order functions, we mean a function that either:

- takes one or more functions as arguments, or
- returns a function as its result

Examples: ```filter```, ```map``` and  ```reduce```.
