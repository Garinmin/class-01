## The structure of html pages

**HTML** - Hyper Text Markup Language
HTML pages are text documents
HTML uses tags

```
<html>
    <head>
        <title>This is a Title</title>
    </head>
    <body>
        <h1>This is a Body</h1>
        <p>This is a text within the Body</p>
    </body>
</html>
```

The _html_ page contains two main elements: <body> and <head>
Inside the <head> element you can find a <title> element
Everithing inside the body element is shown inside the main browser window

**DOCTYPES** tell browsers which version of HTML you are using

## HTML5

HTML5 introduces a new set of elementsthat allow you to devide upthe parts of a page:

* header
* footer
* nav
* article
* aside
* section
* div

Every website should be designed for the target audience. You need to know:

* who is site for
* why people visit your site
* what information your visitors need
