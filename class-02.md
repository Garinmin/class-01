## Introducing CSS

**CSS** works by associating rules with HTML elements.
A CSS rule contains two parts: **selector** and **declaration**

'''p {color: black;}'''

p - selector,  {} - declaration
The **declaration** is made up of two parts: **property** (color:) and **value** (black;)

## Using external CSS

_link href="css/style.css" type="text/css" rel="stylesheet" /_

## Using internal CSS
 
**style** element usually sits inside the <head> element within an HTML page
  _style type="text/css"  h1{declaration} /_
