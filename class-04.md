## Pair Programming

### How does pair programming work?

Pair programming commonly involves two roles: the Driver and the Navigator. 
The **Driver** is the programmer who is typing and the only one whose hands are on the keyboard. 
The **Navigator** uses their words to guide the Driver but does not provide any direct input to the computer.

There are four fundamental skills that help anyone learn coding:

- Listening
- Speaking
- Reading
- Writing

What Pair Programming gives us:

- Greater efficiency
- Engaged collaboration
- Learning from fellow students
- Social skills
- Job interview readiness
- Work environment readiness
